In conclusion, from the data we were able to verify that the analyzed languages follow the law of abbreviation. While we found differences in the the correlations, all of them were negative. Also, we found that some languages are more compressed than others, and that the compression seems to improve the optimization of languages.

The main takeaway from this analysis is that, regardless of differences among languages, the law of abbreviation appears to be universal as described in \cite{bentz2016zipf}.
